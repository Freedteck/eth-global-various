# Smart Various Contract

This project showcases the deployment and interaction with various smart contracts. It includes two key scripts: one for deploying the smart contracts and another for calling their functions once deployed.

Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

Deployment Script: This script is responsible for deploying the smart contracts to your desired network. It handles the necessary configurations, ensuring that the contracts are deployed correctly.

Interaction Script: Once the contracts are deployed, this script allows you to interact with them by calling their functions. It demonstrates how to execute different contract functions and retrieve data.
